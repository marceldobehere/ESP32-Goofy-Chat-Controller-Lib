## ESP32 Goofy Chat Controller Lib

A Lib that aims to provide a way to control an ESP32 / call specific functions from anywhere using the [Goofy Chat 2](https://github.com/marceldobehere/goofy-chat-app-v2) infrastructure.

The Controller will be able to add specific userids with permissions to call certain functions, which can then connect with a custom web or native client and send commands.

The userids will communicated with encrypted data, making it all secure.

This allows the secure remote control of the microcontroller without needing to expose it or an extra server to the public internet.

Although the Goofy Chat 2 server can be self hosted if its wanted.



## NOTE

THIS IS FAR FROM DONE AND VERY WIP RIGHT NOW
